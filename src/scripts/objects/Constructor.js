// constructor and normal function no differences it is just function but constructor start with capital letter;

// Make sure to always call constructors with new ; otherwise, you risk
// changing the global object instead of the newly created object. Consider
// what happens in the following code


// hasOwnProperty()  to check where object as this proery is availble or not


// constructor define property which is not shareble to other instance of object
// but prototype prorerty is shareble to the other instance of object
